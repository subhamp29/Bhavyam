# Changelog

## [1.2] - 2026-10-06

### Added
- **One-tap "Save album to library" on the album detail screen (#79).**
  Previously an album could only be kept by adding its songs one by one to
  a custom playlist. The album hero now has a save button that stores all
  tracks via `PlaylistRepository`, mirroring the feed playlist detail's
  save flow (saving / saved / error states). Shared-playlist pages already
  had this via the feed detail screen.

  Follow-up: the button now detects an already-saved album on every load
  (reopening shows "Saved to library") and saving is idempotent — a
  same-title library copy with overlapping tracks is reused instead of
  stacking duplicates when the tracklist loads progressively.

  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/album/AlbumDetailScreen.kt`
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/playlist/PlaylistRepository.kt` (`findByTitle`)

### Fixed
- **Search returning no results for Cyrillic / non-Latin queries (#102).**
  Title/artist matching used a Latin-only word pattern (`[^a-z0-9]+`),
  reducing every non-Latin query to blank, and the Songs-filtered search had
  no fallback when the filter matched nothing. Matching now uses a
  Unicode-aware pattern (letters + numbers from any script) with
  locale-independent case folding, and an empty filtered search retries once
  unfiltered. Matching helpers were extracted to `TextMatch` with unit tests
  covering Cyrillic, CJK and Arabic input.

  `app/src/test/java/com/bhavya/app/data/music/TextMatchTest.kt` (new)

### Fixed
- **Home-screen widget stuck on the previous song (#94).**
  Two publishers wrote the same widget snapshot with independent dedup
  guards: the playback service (authoritative, fires on every player-state
  transition) and the scrobble listener (watches all media sessions,
  including our own, on an async binder timeline). During a track change
  the listener could still see the previous track's session metadata and
  overwrite the fresh snapshot last, with nothing re-firing afterwards.
  The listener now yields while our own session is active and otherwise
  only elects external packages, and snapshot write + refresh in
  `WidgetUpdater` is mutex-serialized against interleaved publishers.

  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/service/MediaScrobbleListenerService.kt`
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/widget/WidgetUpdater.kt`

### Fixed
- **Logged-out YouTube Music playlists collapsing to a dead "Tap Retry" error.**
  `InnerTubeMusicApi.fetchPlaylist()` treated ANY single continuation-page
  failure (rate-limit/offline blip while paging a large playlist) as a total
  failure and returned null — discarding tracks already loaded — so the
  detail screen showed `Error` and every retry re-fetched from scratch into
  the same failure. Continuation failures now keep the collected prefix and
  return it with `isComplete = false` (null is kept only when zero tracks
  loaded, preserving every caller's existing contract); failures are logged
  to logcat under `BhavyaPlaylist` with browseId + stage for diagnosis.
  `FeedPlaylistDetailViewModel` shows truncated results with an inline
  "Some tracks couldn't load. Retry." affordance instead of the dead error,
  and `YtMusicLibraryManager` no longer poisons the disk cache / track
  count with truncated snapshots (null count forces a network refresh next
  open).

### Author: musaibbhat120605
**Date:** September 16, 2026

###Musaib Bhat will step down as the developer of Bhavya on 16 September 2026. His contributions have been invaluable, and his work will always remain a cornerstone for our community.

#### Added
- **SongPlayStatsEntity + SongPlayStatsDao** — local per-track listening stats (total play time, skip count, play count, last played).
- **SongPlayStatsRepository** — records listened time and skips.
- **LocalTasteSuggestionEngine** — local, Last.fm-free recommendation engine (ported scoring model: play time, skip penalty, liked bonus, recency, time-of-day), seeded via existing `InnerTubeMusicApi.fetchRelatedSongs`.
- **Room migration 12 → 13** — creates `song_play_stats` table without wiping existing data.

#### Changed
- **MusicPlayer.kt** — hooks `onMediaItemTransition` to record listened duration and detect skips (non-AUTO transition + <85% played).
- **AppDatabase.kt / DatabaseModule.kt** — registers the new entity/DAO, bumps DB version, adds migration.
- **FeedScreen.kt** — redesigned `QuickTilesGrid`/`QuickTileCard` (Liked Songs / Mix / New Releases): equal-width scrollable cards with per-type gradient icons, replacing the old grid-chunked layout that left an orphaned half-row.

#### Not yet wired
- `LocalTasteSuggestionEngine.run()` isn't called from any screen yet — integration notes are in the file itself (Feed's discover section or as a Last.fm fallback in `GenerateRepository`).

### Fixed
- **Player state and cached track lost after leaving the app in the background with nothing playing.** (Fix by [@musaibbhat120605](https://github.com/musaibbhat120605))

  `MusicPlaybackService.onTaskRemoved()` unconditionally called
  `musicPlayer.stopAndClear()` whenever the task left Recents — even when
  nothing was playing. `stopAndClear()` wipes both the in-memory player
  state and the persisted session in SharedPreferences
  (`clearPersistedPlaybackSession()`), so the next launch had nothing to
  restore: the player appeared closed and the last track wasn't cached,
  regardless of battery-optimization settings.

  Fixed by (1) skipping the stop entirely when something is actively
  playing, so playback isn't killed just because the task left Recents,
  and (2) giving `stopAndClear()` an optional `clearSession` parameter
  (default `true`, unchanged for every other call site) so the
  paused/idle case can stop the service without deleting the persisted
  session — leaving it restorable on the next launch.

- **Songs silently disappearing from the Home listing during background polling.** (Fix by [@musaibbhat120605](https://github.com/musaibbhat120605))

  `HomeViewModel`'s 12-second background refresh loop merged newly
  polled recent tracks with the existing in-memory history and then
  truncated the **entire combined list** to `HOME_TRACK_HISTORY_CAP`
  (500 entries). `loadNextPage()` (triggered by scrolling) appends
  paginated tracks without any cap of its own — so once a user
  scrolled far enough to load more than 500 tracks, the very next
  background poll would silently drop everything past position 500,
  including tracks the user had just scrolled into view seconds
  earlier. This made songs appear to randomly vanish from the Home
  listing with no user action to explain it.

  Fixed by making the background poll's cap dynamic: it now only
  bounds organic growth from polling (`max(HOME_TRACK_HISTORY_CAP,
  currentListSize)`), so it can never truncate below what pagination
  has already legitimately loaded into view.

  Files changed:
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/home/HomeViewModel.kt`

- **Duplicate/overlapping "now playing" notification on Android 10 (One UI 2.x).**
  `buildNotification()` used `Notification.DecoratedMediaCustomViewStyle`
  with a `MediaSession` attached, alongside a fully custom `RemoteViews`
  player (own artwork, title, artist, transport buttons). On Android 10 +
  Samsung One UI 2.x, SystemUI's older media-notification renderer drew
  its own full media chrome as a second layer instead of just framing the
  custom view, producing two overlapping players in the notification
  shade/quick controls.

  Now version-gated: Android 11+ keeps `DecoratedMediaCustomViewStyle`
  with the session attached as before; Android 10 and below uses
  `Notification.DecoratedCustomViewStyle` (no session tag on the
  notification itself). Lock screen controls, Bluetooth, Android Auto,
  and the in-app widget are unaffected, since they all read from
  `mediaSession` directly rather than this notification's `Style` object.

### Added
- **Offline playback priority across all screens (Fixes #31).**
  `MusicPlayer.resolveTrackAudioStream()` now checks the local Room database (`DownloadedTrackDao`) and verifies file presence on disk before attempting remote network resolution (Lossless / YouTube Music / InnerTube). When a track has already been downloaded, Bhavya plays the local media file directly without making network calls, enabling seamless offline playback across Home, Search, Playlists, Album, and Artist screens and saving cellular data when online.

  Files changed:
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/playback/MusicPlayer.kt`

- **Download state awareness and duplicate download prevention.**
  - Added `DownloadedTrackDao.findByTrackKey` and deduplication checks in `TrackDownloadManager.downloadTrack` to prevent duplicate download jobs, redundant network requests, and duplicate files (e.g. `(1).flac`) in MediaStore.
  - The 3-dot context menu sheet (`TrackContextMenuSheet`) now dynamically reflects the track's status (`Downloaded` with check icon, `Downloading…`, or `Download (Max Quality)`), giving instant visual feedback and preventing accidental re-downloads.

  Files changed:
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/local/db/DownloadedTrackDao.kt`
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/download/TrackDownloadManager.kt`
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/common/TrackContextMenuSheet.kt`

- **Direct navigation from download notifications to the Downloads screen.**
  `TrackDownloadManager` now fires pending intents with `ACTION_VIEW_DOWNLOADS` targeting `DownloadsScreen` (`AppRoute.Downloads`). Integrated an `AppRouteNavigator` singleton and `AppRouteNavBridge` into `NavGraph` and `MainActivity` so tapping download notifications opens the Downloads screen directly instead of only bringing the app to the foreground.

## [4.2.2] - 2026-09-27

### Added
- **System Audio Effects mode (Experimental, default OFF):** publishes the audio session for external equalizer apps and OEM Dolby, flattens in-app DSP airtight on mixer routes, auto-suspends on bit-perfect / USB exclusive.
- **Diagnostics capture:** crash-guard log and startup trail included in the diagnostics export; startup stage breadcrumbs for instant-kill diagnosis.

### Fixed
- **Settings organization:** Equalizer and Studio Clarity moved to Audio → Output & Loudness, liquid glass to Appearance, Experimental reindexed.
- **Playlist duplication races:** serialized add/remove, auto-suffix same-title siblings, monotonic ids.
- **Atmos honesty:** JOC-only capability check plus spatial-manifest veto with step-down cascade to stereo / Opus.
- **Hi-res reporting:** sample-rate driven 24-bit depth inference across resolve, quality pill, signal path, and track details.
- **Lyrics readability:** lyrics-tab blur boost plus readability veil; adaptive transport row no longer clips Next on small screens.
- **Build:** missing YouTubeMusicTrack import, composable-safe backdrop guard.

## [4.2.1] - 2026-09-26

### Added
- **True Bit-Perfect Audio Pipeline:** Introduced true bit-perfect hardware output with native C++ round-to-nearest-even conversion (`lrintf` / `llround`) in `usb-audio-output.cpp`, eliminating 1-LSB negative sample truncation on 24-bit FLAC streams. Added direct C++ integer bit-depth packing to bypass JVM conversion overhead.
- **Dual-Crystal UAC2 Hardware Clock Switching:** Integrated automatic parsing of UAC2 `CLOCK_SOURCE` and `CLOCK_SELECTOR` descriptors to switch dynamically between 44.1 kHz and 48 kHz oscillator families on supported DACs. Added smart Soxr resampling fallback for single-crystal DACs.
- **Expanded Lyrics Ecosystem:** Added support for Apple Music, Better Lyrics, Bini, Musixmatch, and SimpMusic lyrics providers, accompanied by TTML Rich Sync syllable parsing and word-by-word karaoke line splitting.
- **Fluid Artwork Background & Large Widget:** Added animated fluid gradient mesh backgrounds to the player sheet and introduced a new Large Now Playing home screen widget.

### Changed & Improved
- **Audio Download Matching Precision:** Overhauled the download matching engine to apply strict artist penalties, expected duration validation (within 5 seconds), and direct video ID routing from track menus, preventing cross-artist mismatches during downloads.
- **Signal Path Diagnostics:** Signal path dialog now displays exact DAC resampled status, original source bit depth (preventing 32-bit float decoder representation from masking track depth), active hardware sample rates, and detailed USB exclusive open failure diagnostics.
- **Volume & Output Unity Gain:** Removed the restrictive `ignoreStreamMusicMax` cap in `ExclusiveUsbOutput` so 100% volume consistently achieves true 1.0f unity gain.

### Fixed
- **YouTube Liked Music & Playlist Crash:** Fixed a fatal `LazyColumn` key collision and layout edge-reorder crash when opening connected YouTube playlists (`LM` / `yt_liked`). Replaced unstable keys with synchronized, collision-proof occurrence suffixes and guarded layout info reads during progressive track streaming.
- **USB Audio Timing & Glitches:** Corrected exclusive output timing to eliminate buzzing, forward-seek audio cutoffs, runaway seekbar animations, and pause spinner hangs.
- **Player UI Fixes:** Resolved seekbar buffering clock glitches, repeat-one track skipping, and pill button white-out visual issues.

## [4.2.0] - 2026-09-23

### Added
- **Dolby Atmos Playback:** Added Dolby Atmos playback support for compatible devices and audio configurations, providing an enhanced spatial audio experience.
- **Enhanced Liquid Glass:** Completely reworked the Liquid Glass system. The previous implementation was primarily a translucent blur effect; the new implementation introduces significantly improved depth, translucency, reflections, layering, highlights, and overall visual polish for a more refined glass experience.
- **Playlist Downloads:** Added support for downloading complete playlists for offline listening, making it easier to manage and save large collections.
- **True Bit-Perfect Playback:** Improved bit-perfect playback with untouched DAC routing, preserving the audio output path without unnecessary modification or processing.
- **YouTube Recommendation Algorithm:** The entire recommendation system has been shifted from Last.fm to YouTube, providing a new recommendation backend while making Last.fm completely optional.
- **Guest Login:** Added Guest Login, allowing users to use Bhavya without creating or connecting an account.
- **Native Spotify & Apple Music Playlist Import:** Added native playlist importing from Spotify and Apple Music, allowing users to bring their existing playlists directly into Bhavya.

### Changed & Improved
- **Playback & Audio Improvements:** Improved playback reliability, audio handling, DAC behavior, and various edge cases across the playback pipeline.
- **UI & Performance Improvements:** Refined multiple parts of the interface with improved responsiveness, animations, visual consistency, and overall performance.
- **Under-the-Hood Improvements:** A large number of architectural, performance, reliability, and quality-of-life improvements have been made throughout the app.

### Fixed
- **Stability & Bug Fixes:** Fixed numerous reported issues across playback, downloads, recommendations, authentication, UI, and background behavior.

## 2026-09-02 — musaibbhat120605

### Fixed
- **WebM/Opus downloads not showing metadata in external players/file managers.**
  `AudioTagWriter.embedIntoWebm()` previously appended the `Tags`/`Attachments`
  elements at the very end of the file, after all audio `Cluster` data. This
  produced structurally valid EBML, but many players and file managers only
  scan the header region of a WebM/Matroska file (stopping once they reach
  audio data) instead of reading the whole file, so the tags were effectively
  invisible outside the app.

  Metadata is now spliced in right before the first `Cluster`, matching where
  real muxers place it:
  - Any existing `SeekHead` is dropped instead of left with stale offsets —
    compliant readers fall back to a normal sequential scan when it's absent.
  - Any existing `Tags`/`Attachments` elements are removed so duplicates
    aren't left behind.
  - The `Segment` size field is patched to match the new layout.
  - If a `Cues` index is present (rare for YouTube's DASH audio, but possible
    for other muxed sources), the old end-of-file append is used instead,
    since rewriting `Cues` byte offsets safely is out of scope for this fix.

  Files changed: `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/download/AudioTagWriter.kt`

### Fixed
- **Home screen (Last.fm) lag / stutter.**
  `HomeUiState.visibleRows()` (filters, day-groups, sorts, and dedupes the
  full track history) was being recomputed inline inside a Compose
  `remember` block, which runs on the UI thread. Last.fm's now-playing and
  recent-tracks polling ticks every 12–30 seconds, so every time a track
  scrobbled in, this fairly expensive rebuild ran right on the frame meant
  to update the screen, causing a visible stutter tied directly to
  scrobbling. On top of that, the "Recent" track list was never capped, so
  it kept growing (and getting more expensive to rebuild) the longer Home
  stayed open in a session.

  - `HomeViewModel` now recomputes the row list on a background dispatcher
    (`Dispatchers.Default`) and exposes it as its own `StateFlow`, so the UI
    thread just collects a finished list instead of building it.
  - The 30-second recent-tracks poll now caps the merged track history at
    500 entries instead of growing it indefinitely.

  Files changed:
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/home/HomeViewModel.kt`,
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/home/HomeScreen.kt`

### Fixed
- **Downloaded tracks appearing twice in the Downloads list.**
  `TrackDownloadManager.downloadTrack()` had no check against tracks that
  were already downloaded — it only guarded against the *same* download
  running twice concurrently (`activeKeys`), which is cleared as soon as a
  download finishes. Re-downloading a track you already had correctly
  overwrote the file on disk, but `downloadedTrackDao.insert()` always
  created a brand-new row: `DownloadedTrackEntity.id` is an
  autoincrement primary key with no other unique constraint, so
  `OnConflictStrategy.REPLACE` never had anything to actually collide
  with.

  - Added a normalized `trackKey` column (`"${artist}_${title}"`,
    lowercased/trimmed) with a **unique index**, so the database itself
    can no longer hold two rows for the same track.
  - Migration `10 → 11` backfills `trackKey` for existing rows, deletes
    any duplicate rows already present (keeping the most recently
    downloaded copy of each), then creates the unique index.
  - `downloadTrack()` now checks the database first; if the track is
    already downloaded and its file still exists, it skips re-downloading
    entirely instead of re-fetching and duplicating. If the file was
    removed outside the app, it falls through and re-downloads, and the
    unique index makes that insert safely `REPLACE` the stale row instead
    of duplicating it.

  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/local/db/DownloadedTrackEntity.kt`,
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/di/DatabaseModule.kt`,
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/data/download/TrackDownloadManager.kt`

### Fixed
- **Skipping to the next track did nothing when playing from Downloads.**
  `DownloadsViewModel.playTrack()` started playback via `MusicPlayer.play()`,
  which always builds a single-track queue (`listOf(track)`) regardless of
  how many tracks are downloaded. So the moment you played anything from the
  Downloads screen, the player's queue had exactly one item — there was
  never a "next" track to advance to, so `next()` correctly found no
  following item and silently did nothing.

  `playTrack()` now builds the full queue from every currently downloaded
  track (in the same order shown on screen), starting at the tapped
  track's position, via `MusicPlayer.playQueue()` instead of `play()`.
  Next/previous now move through the rest of your downloads normally.

  Files changed:
  `app/src/main/java/com/bhavya/app/ui/settings/DownloadsViewModel.kt`
