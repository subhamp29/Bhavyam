 * Resolves a track through installed provider modules — one call per song.
 *
 * JSON-only (LWP2) world: modules carry config (URL + secret) that the app
 * consumes natively in LosslessMusicApi, so there is nothing module-side to
 * execute. The legacy QuickJS script runtime has been removed entirely, so
 * this resolver always falls through to the normal chain (direct backend,
 * then YouTube) and only maps quality tiers for callers. Signatures are kept
 * so existing call sites compile untouched; every method is non-throwing.
