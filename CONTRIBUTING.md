## Architecture Overview

Bhavya is built using modern Android architecture patterns:
* **UI Layer:** Jetpack Compose, Material 3, Navigation Compose.
* **Audio Engine:** ExoPlayer / Media3 with Jellyfin FFmpeg software decoders and custom C++ DSP processing (`AudioEngine.cpp`).
* **Dependency Injection:** Dagger Hilt.
* **Storage & Caching:** Room Database, DataStore Preferences.
* **Networking:** Retrofit, OkHttp 4, Kotlinx Serialization.

## Development Guidelines

### Branching Strategy
* `main` contains the latest stable development code.
* Create feature or bugfix branches from `main` using descriptive names:
  * `feat/your-feature-name`
  * `fix/issue-description`

### Code Style & Quality
* Follow official Kotlin coding conventions and Android Architecture recommendations.
* Keep composables focused, stateless where possible, and extract complex state into ViewModels.
* Ensure all native C++ code respects 16KB memory page alignment constraints for Android 15+.
* Avoid embedding hardcoded API secrets or URLs directly in source files.

### Testing
Run local unit tests before opening a pull request:
```bash
./gradlew testDebugUnitTest
```

## Submitting a Pull Request

1. Push your branch to your fork.
2. Open a Pull Request against the `main` branch.
3. Provide a concise summary of changes, problem analysis, and testing steps in the PR description.
4. Ensure continuous integration checks pass.
5. Address reviewer feedback promptly.
